function [best_plane, indicies, no_best_plane] = getGroundPlane( points, maxInclinationAngle, tol )
%GETGROUNDPLANE Takes a struct voxelGrid as obtained from createVoxelStruct and returns the parameters of
%the plane which most probably is the ground plane, following the RANSAC
%plane fitting algorithm
%
%NOTE: this function works well when the floor is a significantly 
%extended planar surface in the bottom of the image. Specifying a 
%maxInclinationAngle can improve results also when seeing only limited floor
%areas in the photo.
%
% [best_plane, PNout, best_count] = getGroundPlane( voxelGrid, maxInclinationAngle, tol )
%
%   input:      
%       points     = points as obtained from getVoxelGrid
%       
%       maxInclinationAngle = (optional) scalar number (in degrees) expressing the
%                     maximum inclination angle that the camera can be
%                     submitted to (both pitch and roll) w.r.t. an ideal position
%                     that look exactly straight and parallel to the floor plane.
%                     If not present, the algorithm assumes that the camera
%                     can be inclinated to a max of 80 degree. Restricting
%                     the maximum inclination can help the algorithm in
%                     finding the correct floor plane also in proximity of
%                     vertical walls. The lowest value is however 10 degree
%                     and the maximum 90 degree.
%       tol         = (optional) tolerance to be used to test when a point
%                     belongs to a plane. Default value is 1e-6.
%
%   output:
%       best_plane  = column vector containing the [a b c d] parameters of the
%                     plane  a*x + b*y + c*z + d = 0 which is considered to
%                     be the ground plane.
%       best_count  = number of votes received by best_plane
